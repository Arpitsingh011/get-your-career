        <h2>Welcome to our College</h2>
        <p class="shobhitkumar">
            There is a lot of misconceptions and confusion among students when it comes to choosing B.Sc. or B.Tech. after 12th.

A common misconception is B.Tech. (engineering) is better than B.Sc. (pure science), while a few confident students stick to B.Sc. as their career goals are clear. Some feel B.Tech. is tough and they wonâ€™t be able to perform up to the expected level, while others feel B.Sc. is way too easy.

To remove this confusion and misconceptions, we look a the different aspects, scope, difficulty level, career prospects, etc., involved in these two courses and maybe help you in choosing either B.Sc. or B.Tech.

The BSc subjects are designed to keep more focus on the Honours subject and also include subjects or papers from the elective subjects students opt for. The purpose of studying the BSc subjects is to inculcate theoretical, practical and research skills among students.On the other hand, a BSc provides basic knowledge of the major Science subjects to the students. The BSc subjects are slightly less rigorous, but it includes both theoretical and practical components.
         The pedagogy of BSc courses is a combination of theory and practical lessons. The BSc subjects include practical lessons which carry a considerable amount of weightage. To pass a semester, students need to pass both the theory as well practical exams. Subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics form the core of the BSc. There are a plethora of specialisations and branches offered in the BSc courses.The 3-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science (BSc Full Form) degree is recognised across India.
